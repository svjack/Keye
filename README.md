## üìê Quick Start
### Preprocess and Inference

See [keye-vl-utils/README.md](keye-vl-utils/README.md) for details. ```Keye-vl-utils``` contains a set of helper functions for processing and integrating visual language information with Keye Series Model.

#### Install

```bash
pip install keye-vl-utils
```

#### Keye-VL Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor
from keye_vl_utils import process_vision_info

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model_path = "Kwai-Keye/Keye-VL-8B-Preview"

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_path, torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto", attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", trust_remote_code=True,
).to('cuda')

# You can set the maximum tokens for a video through the environment variable VIDEO_MAX_PIXELS
# based on the maximum tokens that the model can accept. 
# export VIDEO_MAX_PIXELS = 32000 * 28 * 28 * 0.9


# You can directly insert a local file path, a URL, or a base64-encoded image into the position where you want in the text.

### Evaluation
See [evaluation/KC-MMBench/README.md](evaluation/KC-MMBench/README.md) for details.

## üëÄ Architecture and Training Strategy

<div align="center">
  <img src="asset/architecture.png" width="100%" alt="Kwai Keye Architecture">
  <i> The Kwai Keye-VL model architecture is based on the Qwen3-8B language model and incorporates a vision encoder initialized from the open-source SigLIP. It supports native dynamic resolution, preserving the original aspect ratio of images by dividing each into a 14x14 patch sequence. A simple MLP layer then maps and merges the visual tokens. The model uses 3D RoPE for unified processing of text, image, and video information, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between position encoding and absolute time to ensure precise perception of temporal changes in video information.</i>
</div>


### üåü Pre-Train

<div align="center">
  <img src="asset/pre-train.png" width="100%" alt="Kwai Keye Pretraining">
  <i>The Kwai Keye pre-training pipeline, featuring a four-stage progressive strategy: Image-Text Matching, ViT-LLM Alignment, Multi-task Pre-training, and Annealing with model merging.</i>
</div>
<details>
  <summary>More Details</summary>

  #### Pre-training Data: Massive, High-Quality, Diverse

  - **Diversity**: Includes image-text pairs, videos, pure text, etc., with tasks such as fine-grained description, OCR, Q&A, localization, and more.
  - **High Quality**: Data is filtered using CLIP scores and VLM discriminators, and MinHASH is used for deduplication to prevent data leakage.
  - **Self-Built Datasets**: High-quality internal datasets are specifically constructed, especially for detailed captions and Chinese OCR, to compensate for the shortcomings of open-source data.

  #### Training Process: Four-Stage Progressive Optimization
  Kwai Keye-VL adopts a four-stage progressive training strategy:

  - **Stage 0 (Visual Pre-training)**: Continuously pre-trains the visual encoder to adapt to internal data distribution and support dynamic resolution.
  - **Stage 1 (Cross-Modal Alignment)**: Freezes the backbone model and trains only the MLP to establish robust image-text alignment at low cost.
  - **Stage 2 (Multi-Task Pre-training)**: Unlocks all parameters to comprehensively enhance the model's visual understanding capabilities.
  - **Stage 3 (Annealing Training)**: Fine-tunes with high-quality data to further improve the model's fine-grained understanding capabilities.

  Finally, Kwai Keye-VL explores isomorphic heterogeneous fusion technology by averaging parameters of annealed training models with different data ratios, reducing model bias while retaining multidimensional capabilities, thereby enhancing the model's robustness.

</details>


### üåü Post-Train

The post-training phase of Kwai Keye-VL-1.5 is meticulously designed into two phases, aiming to comprehensively enhance the model's performance, especially its reasoning ability in complex tasks. This is a key breakthrough for achieving advanced cognitive functions.

#### Stage I. No-Reasoning Training: SFT+MPO


<details>
  <summary>More Details</summary>

- **Stage I.1: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
  - Data Composition: Includes 5 million multimodal data, built on a diverse task classification system (70,000 tasks) using the self-developed TaskGalaxy framework. High-difficulty data is selected by multimodal large models and manually annotated to ensure data quality and challenge.

- **Stage I.2: Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO)**
  - Data Composition: Comprises open-source data and pure text preference data. Bad cases from the SFT model are used as quality prompts, and preference data is generated through rejection sampling using Qwen2.5VL 72B and SFT models, with manual scoring and ranking.

</details>

<div align="center">
  <img src="asset/post1.png" width="100%" alt="Kwai Keye Post-Training">
  <i>Keye-VL-1.5's post-training is composed of Non-Reasoning Stage and Reasoning Stage, non-reasoning stage includes large-scale SFT and MPO, Reasoning Stage includes three steps: CoT Cold-Start, General RL and Alignment RL.</i>
</div>

#### Stage II. Reasoning Training: Core Breakthrough for Complex Cognition

<div align="center">
  <img src="asset/post2.png" width="100%" alt="LongCoT data generation pipeline">
  <br>
  <i>Overview of our five-step automated LongCoT data generation pipeline. .</i>
</div>


<details>
  <summary>More Details</summary>

- **Step II.1: CoT Cold-Start**
  - Objective: Cold-start the model's chain of thought reasoning ability, allowing it to mimic human step-by-step thinking.
  - Data Composition: Combines non-reasoning data (330,000), reasoning data (230,000), auto-reasoning data (20,000), and agentic reasoning data (100,000) to teach the model different modes.
    - Thinking Data: Focuses on high-difficulty perception and reasoning scenarios like math, science, charts, complex Chinese, and OCR, using multimodal large models for multiple sampling and evaluation to build over 70,000 complex thought chain data.
    - Pure Text Data: Constructs a pure text long thought chain dataset from dimensions like code, math, science, instruction following, and general reasoning tasks.
    - Auto-Think Data: Automatically selects "think" or "no_think" modes based on the complexity of prompts, enabling adaptive reasoning mode switching.
    - Think with Image Data: 100,000 agent data entries, asking Qwen 2.5 VL-72B if image operations (e.g., cropping, rotating, enhancing contrast) are needed to simplify problems or improve answer quality, combined with external sandbox code execution to empower the model to solve problems by writing code to manipulate images or perform mathematical calculations.
  - Training Strategy: Trains with a mix of four modes to achieve cold-start in different reasoning modes.
- **Step II.2: CoT-Mix RL**
  - Objective: Deeply optimize the model's comprehensive abilities in multimodal perception, reasoning, pure text math, short video understanding, and agentic tasks through reinforcement learning based on the chain of thought, making the reasoning process more robust and efficient.
  - Data Composition: Covers complex tasks from multimodal perception (complex text recognition, object counting), multimodal reasoning, high-difficulty math problems, short video content understanding to Think with Image.
  - Training Strategy: Uses a mix-mode GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning, where reward signals evaluate both the correctness of results and the consistency of the process and results, ensuring synchronized optimization of reasoning processes and final outcomes.
- **Step II.2: Iterative Alignment**
  - Objective: Address common issues like repetitive crashes and poor logic in model-generated content, and enable spontaneous reasoning mode selection to enhance final performance and stability.
  - Data Composition: Constructs preference data through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT), combining rule-based scoring (judging repetition, instruction following, etc.) and model scoring (cognitive scores provided by large models) to rank various model responses, building a high-quality preference dataset.
  - Training Strategy: Multi-round iterative optimization with the constructed "good/bad" preference data pairs through the MPO algorithm. This aims to correct model generation flaws and ultimately enable it to intelligently and adaptively choose whether to activate deep reasoning modes based on problem complexity.
